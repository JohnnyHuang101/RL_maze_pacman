RL experiements conducted by johnny. I took a in depth look at how to crack the most optimal way to play pacman.
The agent I developed seeks ideas ranging from simple MinMax game search to a more complex RL based deep Q learning
algorihm for pathing out decisions. Next steps might be to implement Bayesian decision theory modeling or whatever i learn idk.
